# Embryo NeRF 
Embryo NeRF is an implementation of nano NeRF that will be 3D reconstructing microscopic images of an Embryo. The following are the planned steps.
- Step one is to train a NeRF model that can 3D reconstruct synthetic sphere like structure. The synthetic dataset is prepared using a python script called generate_sphere.py
- Step two is to train the pre-trained model and fine tune it to generate the actual 3D embryos.
